  Works for any number of predicates in the where clause as long as they are in groups of 3, e.g. [:id > 1 :id < 4 :name not= 'isak']
  Note: this could be in the macro above as an alternative (if (> (count where) 3)) but is done separate for any automated grading/testing, also leaves out whitelisting operators"
